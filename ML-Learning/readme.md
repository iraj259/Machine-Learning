Interview cheat sheet for ML
1. ML Basics

Definition: ML = models learn patterns from data to predict or decide.

Difference from traditional programming: ML adapts from data; traditional programs follow fixed rules.

2. Types of ML

Supervised: Labeled data → output known

Examples: Regression, Classification

Unsupervised: Unlabeled data → finds patterns

Types: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, Anomaly Detection, Association Rules

Reinforcement: Learn via environment interactions + rewards

3. Training Strategies

Batch Learning: Train on full dataset; retrain for new data. Use when data is static.

Online Learning: Incremental updates with new data. Use when data changes frequently.

Out-of-Core: Process large datasets in small chunks.

4. Learning Approach

Instance-Based: Stores examples; predicts using similarity (kNN).

Model-Based: Learns patterns/functions; predicts using model (Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees).
