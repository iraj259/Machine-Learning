Day 1 was all about the basics of ML. Then I learned the difference b/w AI/ML/DL and the difference b/w superVised and unsupervised learning and their types.

Day 2 was all about learning the online machine learning. The difference between the online machine learning and the batch machine learning was that in the batch machine learning we have to train the model on all the data and then we can use the model to make predictions. But in the online machine learning we can train the model on the data as it comes and then we can use the model to make predictions. And the difference between the instance based and the model based learning.
So in instance based the model basically memorizes and it is lazy or do not anything while in the training mode until a new data comes. But in the model based learning the model is active and it is doing something while the training mode is active. It basically creates a decision boundary by learning from data and make prediction of new data on its basis.
