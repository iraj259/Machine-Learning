ML Interview Cheat Sheet (Day 1–3)
1. ML Basics

Q: What is Machine Learning?
A: ML is a subset of AI where models learn patterns from data to predict or decide, unlike traditional programming which follows fixed rules.

2. Types of ML

Q: Difference between Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning?

Supervised: Labeled data → output known (Regression, Classification)

Unsupervised: Unlabeled data → finds patterns (Clustering, PCA, Anomaly Detection, Association Rules)

Reinforcement: Learns via environment interactions + rewards

3. Training Strategies

Q: Batch vs Online Learning?

Batch: Train on full dataset; retrain if new data; for static datasets

Online: Incremental updates; for streaming or frequently changing data

Out-of-Core: Process large datasets in small chunks

4. Learning Approaches

Q: Instance-Based vs Model-Based Learning?

Instance-Based: Stores examples; predicts using similarity (kNN)

Model-Based: Learns patterns/functions; predicts using model (Linear Regression, Decision Trees)

5. Challenges of ML

Q: Common challenges in ML?

Data quality, missing/bias

Overfitting / underfitting

Model interpretability

Computational resources

Concept drift

Data privacy

6. Applications of ML

Q: Where is ML applied?

Healthcare: disease prediction, medical imaging

Finance: fraud detection, credit scoring

E-commerce: recommendations, segmentation

Transportation: self-driving cars

NLP: chatbots, sentiment analysis

Computer Vision: facial recognition, object detection
