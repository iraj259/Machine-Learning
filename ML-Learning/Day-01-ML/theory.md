# Day 01: Introduction to Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning (ML)?
Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to **learn and improve from experience** without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of ML

### 1. Supervised Learning
Models are trained on labeled data (input-output pairs).

- Regression: Predict continuous values, e.g., house prices
- Classification: Predict categories, e.g., spam vs. not spam

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Models find patterns or structure in unlabeled data.

- Clustering: Group similar data points, e.g., customer segmentation
- Association: Discover relationships between variables, e.g., market basket analysis
- Dimensionality Reduction: Reduce features while retaining important information, e.g., PCA
- Anomaly Detection: Identify unusual patterns or outliers, e.g., fraud detection

### 3. Reinforcement Learning (Optional)
Agents learn by interacting with the environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

### Batch Learning

Batch learning is when the model is trained on the entire dataset at once.
The model does not update incrementally with new data; if new data comes, the model is retrained from scratch.
Useful for offline learning where all data is available beforehand.



## Key Takeaways
- Supervised learning uses labeled data; unsupervised learning does not.
- Choose the right ML type depending on your problem and available data.
- Batch learning trains the model on all data at once and requires     retraining for new data.
