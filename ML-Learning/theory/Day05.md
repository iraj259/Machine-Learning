# Day 5 â€“ Data Engineer vs Data Analyst vs Data Scientist vs ML Engineer

## Data Engineer
- **Focus:** Building and maintaining data pipelines and infrastructure  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Collecting and cleaning raw data  
  - Designing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows  
  - Managing databases, data warehouses, and big data tools  
- **Tools:** SQL, Spark, Hadoop, Airflow, Kafka  

---

## Data Analyst
- **Focus:** Interpreting data to generate insights for decision-making  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Querying structured data (SQL, Excel)  
  - Creating dashboards & reports  
  - Performing descriptive & diagnostic analytics  
- **Tools:** SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, Python (basic)  

---

## Data Scientist
- **Focus:** Applying statistical and ML methods to extract insights and build predictive models  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Data exploration & feature engineering  
  - Applying ML algorithms for prediction & classification  
  - Communicating results with stakeholders  
- **Tools:** Python, R, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter, ML frameworks  

---

## ML Engineer
- **Focus:** Building, optimizing, and deploying ML models in production  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Model training, tuning, and evaluation  
  - Deploying ML models (APIs, pipelines, real-time systems)  
  - Monitoring and retraining models  
- **Tools:** Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Docker, Kubernetes, MLflow  



## Interview Q&A

**Q: How is an ML Engineer different from a Data Scientist?**  
A: A Data Scientist focuses more on research, model building, and experimentation. An ML Engineer focuses on scaling, deploying, and maintaining those models in production.  

**Q: Why is a Data Engineer important for ML projects?**  
A: Without clean, reliable, and accessible data pipelines, ML projects fail. Data Engineers ensure the foundation for analytics and ML.
