# Day 03: Challenges and Applications of Machine Learning

## Challenges of Machine Learning
- **Data Quality:** Poor, missing, or biased data affects model performance.  
- **Overfitting & Underfitting:** Models may memorize training data or fail to capture patterns.  
- **Interpretability:** Some models (like deep learning) are hard to explain.  
- **Computational Resources:** Large datasets and complex models require significant CPU/GPU.  
- **Changing Environments:** Models trained on old data may fail if real-world data changes (concept drift).  
- **Data Privacy & Security:** Sensitive data must be handled carefully.

## Applications of Machine Learning
- **Healthcare:** Disease prediction, medical image analysis.  
- **Finance:** Fraud detection, credit scoring, algorithmic trading.  
- **E-commerce:** Product recommendations, customer segmentation.  
- **Transportation:** Self-driving cars, route optimization.  
- **Natural Language Processing:** Chatbots, language translation, sentiment analysis.  
- **Computer Vision:** Facial recognition, object detection.  

## Key Takeaways
- ML has **wide-ranging applications**, but building successful models requires addressing challenges like data quality, overfitting, and computational limitations.  
- Choosing the right algorithm and approach depends on **data, problem type, and resources**.
